**Good day to you**

I'm a Computer Science and Media Design bachelors graduate. Anything web-dev, full-stack, or game-dev related are my interests as of late!

*This Github contains an array of my personal projects and some of my uni projects*

- I’m currently learning how to create different types of websites, using react, javascript or python.
- I’m looking to learn anything new related to technology!
